# Design-RISC-V-Processor-Using-Verilog-
This is my Final Year Major Project 

The Design and Implementation of a RISC-V Processor project involved creating a 5-stage pipelined processor using Verilog HDL, adhering to RISC-V architecture principles. 
The stages included Instruction Fetch, Decode, Execute, Memory Access, and Write Back. The processor supported key instructions like arithmetic (ADD, SUB), logical (AND, OR),
branch (BNEQZ, BEQZ), and memory operations (LOAD, STORE). Modular design ensured each stage was independently verified and integrated seamlessly.
A comprehensive testbench validated its functionality, with simulation tools aiding in debugging and RTL visualization. This project highlights expertise in processor design, pipelining,
and hardware verification, with applications in IoT, embedded systems, and academic research.
