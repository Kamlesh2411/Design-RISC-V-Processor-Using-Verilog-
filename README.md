# Design-RISC-V-Processor-Using-Verilog-
This is my Final Year Major Project 

Project Name: Design and Implementation of a RISC-V Processor

Problem Statement: To develop a 5-stage pipelined processor adhering to the RISC-V architecture to execute key arithmetic, logical, branch, and memory operations.

How I Solved It: Designed and implemented individual pipeline stages (Instruction Fetch, Decode, Execute, Memory Access, Write Back) using Verilog HDL. Each stage was independently tested and integrated into a modular design. A comprehensive testbench validated the processor's functionality with simulation tools aiding in debugging and visualization.

Technology Used: Verilog HDL, simulation tools, RISC-V architecture principles. This project demonstrates expertise in processor design, pipelining, and hardware verification with applications in IoT, embedded systems, and academic research.
